## LAB 10 

The Main advantage of using Aspect J in the gumball machine is to reduces the code and it is easy to maintain. Managing class for different 
gumball machine becomes a problematic issue when there are many gumball machines but with Aspect J we could change the sturcture of gumball
machine by just changing the config file so that we would add the class at compile time. This is very good feature when it comes
to implementing the code seperating the business logic from other cross cutting logics.
